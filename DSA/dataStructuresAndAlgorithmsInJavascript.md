- Asymptotic analysis is a method used to evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its order of growth, which is how the algorithm's resource usage (usually time or space) scales with the size of the input.
- This analysis is independent of the specific machine or programming language used to implement the algorithm.
- A function f(n) is said to be growing faster than another function g(n) if
  - $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{g(n)}{f(n)} = 0$$
    _The limit of g(n) divided by f(n) as n approaches infinity equals zero._
  - OR
  - $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \infty$$
    _The limit of f(n) divided by g(n) as n approaches infinity is infinity._
